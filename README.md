# Restarting from CRT
<p>This repo should be read after https://github.com/xyzhyn/Chinese-remainder-theorem. <br>
As already mentioned, I'll try to get the most out https://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/notes/numbertheory in order to set a good math background to understand https://zcash.github.io/halo2 trying to simplify the path for anyone would want to approach that book. <br>
In the ending section of the CRT repo I wrote that the number of square roots of unity is ~ $z^{congruences}$ where $congruences$ divisors are pairwise coprime; the '~' is because for example if we had $x^{2} \equiv 1 \mod 2$, since $1 \mod 2 = -1 \mod 2$ we would have 1 solution in this case which would break $z^{congruences}$ leading to $z^{congruences - 1}$. Also I wrote $z$ to be more general than '2' but take it with a pinch because there could be corner cases, and also mixed degrees into the starting congruences so just move forward and don't give it too much importance because it's very likely to be broken.<br>
The important thing to understand is that <em>"to describe the solutions of a polynomial f(x) over </em>$Z_{n}$<em> for any n we need to find the roots of f(x) over </em>$Z_{{p}^{k}}$<em> for prime powers </em>$p^{k}$<em>".</em>

## Wilson's theorem
<p>Things start getting harder here, but I'll try to simplify this expl. as much as possible.<br>
The theorem states that for any integer $p > 1$ we have $(p - 1)! = - 1 \mod p$ if and only if p is prime. To understand this lightning fast just think about this: every number from $1$ to $p - 1 (\mod p)$ has a multiplicative modular inverse and that inverse is unique for that number with two exceptions: $1$ and $p - 1$ whose inverses are themselves. Then why multiplying them makes the rule to hold? Simply because $1(p - 1) = p - 1 = - 1 (\mod p)$. The hard thing to prove here is the uniqueness and existence of multiplicative modular inverses from $1$ to $p - 1$ which I proved in the final section of https://github.com/xyzhyn/Fermat-Little-Theorem-proof. Now let's understand why this formula is enough to prove that $p$ is prime. If $p$ wasn't prime it should mean that $p$ is composed by $2$ or more primes multiplied, then from our previous reasoning about roots of unity the formula wouldn't produce $- 1$ as result, (also) because of roots of unity which are the inverses of themselves. Powers of $2$ follow a different reasoning; they don't have $1$ root of unity like one might think from $1 \mod 2 = -1 \mod 2$ but they have two of them ($1$ and $p - 1$), does this breaks the rule then? No, because of multiplicative modular inverses from $2$ to $p - 2$: powers of $2$, and generally every integer obtained from primes multiplied don't follow this: <em>"uniqueness and existence of multiplicative modular inverses from 2 to p - 2".</em> Let's make 2 simple examples: <br>
  
$2 \mod 4$<br>
-><br>
$1$ is a root of unity.<br>
$2$ is not a multiplicative modular inverse nor a root of unity.<br>
$3$ is a root of unity.<br>

$x \mod 15$<br>
-><br>
$1$ is a root of unity.<br>
$2$ and $8$ are multiplicative modular inverses.<br>
$3$ is neither a root nor an inverse.<br>
$4$ is a root of unity.<br>
$5$ is neither a root nor an inverse.<br>
$6$ is neither a root nor an inverse (it has 3 in it).<br>
$7$ and $13$ are multiplicative modular inverses.<br>
$9$ is neither a root nor an inverse (it has 3 in it).<br>
$10$ is neither a root nor an inverse (it has 5 in it).<br>
$11$ is a root of unity.<br>
$12$ is neither a root nor an inverse (it has 3 in it).<br>
$14$ is a root of unity.<br>

R----I----X----R----X----X----I----I----X----X----R----X----I----R<br>

Where R = root, I = inverse, X = neither one of them.

Some simmetry is individuable here but for the moment we are not interested about this.<br> What we actually care about is that it's clear that whenever there are non-coprimes in the set, there are elements which are not roots nor inverses then it's resonable to assert that Wilson's theorem holds. The problem is about the 'only if' statement inside the theorem which should be proved but I'm moving forward assuming it's true.<br>

Before moving forward let's see another example with a prime modulo:<br>

$x \mod 17$<br>
-><br>
$1$ is a root of unity.<br>
$2$ and $9$ are multiplicative modular inverses.<br>
$3$ and $6$ are multiplicative modular inverses.<br>
$4$ and $13$ are multiplicative modular inverses.<br>
$5$ and $7$ are multiplicative modular inverses.<br>
$8$ and $15$ are multiplicative modular inverses.<br>
$10$ and $12$ are multiplicative modular inverses.<br>
$11$ and $14$ are multiplicative modular inverses.<br>
$16$ is a root of unity.<br>

R----I----I----I----I----I----I----I----I----I----I----I----I----I----I----R<br>
</p>

## Units
<p>Now we can easily derive this concept of units and correlate that with Totient function:<br>
if $z \in Z_{n}$ has an inverse then $z$ is a unit. The set of units is denoted by $Z_{n}^{*}$. <br>
From the previous section is clear that $z$ is a unit if and only if $z$ and $n$ are coprime. Here appears the Totient function which is useful to calculate the number of coprimes of an integer. See https://github.com/xyzhyn/Euler-Totient-function-multiplicativity-demonstration if you are interested.
</p>

## Modular exp. and DLP
<p>These are well covered in https://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/notes/numbertheory/exp.html so I won't delve them. The absence of a structure of the powers of $x \mod p$ is quite magical and it's one of the foundations of cryptography (even if the actual process which destroy the structure is combined with elliptic curves in PLONK). Also notice how $3^{x} \equiv 6 \mod 7$ solving formula decreases the modulo by 1 ($x \equiv 3 \mod 6$), this could be helpful further on.
</p>

## Nonunits
<p>From the previous example is clear that we will always face nonunits every time we deal with some $\mod n$ where $n$ is not prime. It's also clear that if $n = p^{k}$ for some prime $p$, we will face non-units for every $dp \mod n$ term (for any $d > 1$).<br> 
Not only that, we can be sure that since $(dp)^{n} = d^{n}p^{n}$ we will have $(dp)^{n} \equiv 0 \mod n$ for any $zn$ where $z > 1$. Here Ben Lynn is not clear about why actually we don't bother about nonunits so I'll provide my view: at least from elliptic curves operations (but I guess this is reflected in the DLP, playing with crypto formulas) we don't want to get a 0 from multiplications because $0$ breaks the unstructured (unpredictable) behaviour of the modular exp. (DLP) and elliptic curves, and since modular multiplicative groups are cyclic we would end up having a lot of zeros around. That's why usually crypto operations use $\mod p$ where $p$ is a very big prime (but it could not be always the case -> the more you know the more you are prepared).

## Fermat's Little Theorem and Euler's Theorem
<p>
  Check https://github.com/xyzhyn/Fermat-Little-Theorem-proof. It contains every necessary proof of both theorems.
</p>

## RSA
<p>
  Now we can do a little deviation into RSA without delving too much.<br>
  
  1. We calculate N as mult. of (big primes) or mult. of powers of primes. I guess the right approach here is to use $2$ big random primes, or powers of those (there are soo many things to take into consideration while setting up an asimmetric crypto protocol which has to be resistant to attacks, so I could be wrong easily, DYOR).
  
  2. Since we know the prime factors of N we can easily calculate $\phi(N)$.
  
  3. We take our message $a$ and calc. $a^{e} \mod N$ (encryption).
  
  4. To decrypt it we need to find $d$ such that $a^{ed} \equiv a \mod N$.
  
  5. If $ed = \phi(N) + 1$ (or $ed = (k)\phi(N) + 1$), since: $a^{(k)\phi(N) + 1} \equiv a \mod N$ we would have reached our goal so (since we know $e$) we can calc. $d$ doing:
     - $ed = (k)\phi(N) + 1$
     - $d = \frac{(k)\phi(N) + 1}{e}$ = $((k)\phi(N) + 1) e^{-1}$
     - $d \equiv e^{-1} \mod \phi(N)$ (which is not computable without factoring N).

  [ Currently https://github.com/xyzhyn/Fermat-Little-Theorem-proof doesn't contain a proof for $a^{\phi(N) + 1} \equiv a \mod N$ ].

## Primality tests

### Fermat test
<p>
  By Fermat's Little Theorem:<br>
  $a^{p - 1} \equiv 1 \mod p$

  Hence picking a random integer $z$ and a random $0 < a < z$, if:<br>
 $a^{z - 1} \equiv 1 \mod z$ should $z$ be prime? Well it could :D.<br>

  Given $z = 561 = 3 * 11 * 17$ (not prime):<br>
  $a^{560} \equiv 1 \mod 561$<br>
for any $a$ which is coprime with $z$. These numbers are called Carmichael numbers. To conclude, if $a$ is not coprime to $z$ the Fermat test succeeds (I don't know why Ben Lynn says that it fails) otherwise it breaks; i.e. since $a$ shares a factor with $z$, this doesn't hold:

  $(x, y, z) \in Z_{3}^{\ast} \times Z_{11}^{\ast} \times Z_{17}^{\ast}$<br>
  $(1, 1, 1) \in Z_{3}^{\ast} \times Z_{11}^{\ast} \times Z_{17}^{\ast} = 1 \mod 561$

  infact (taking $3$ as co-factor example):

  $(0, 1, 1) \in Z_{3}^{\ast} \times Z_{11}^{\ast} \times Z_{17}^{\ast}$<br>
  $(1, 1) \in Z_{11}^{\ast} \times Z_{17}^{\ast} = 1 \mod 187$

  and:

  $x \equiv 1 \mod 187$<br>
  $x \equiv 1 \mod 3$<br>
  $\equiv$<br>
  $x \equiv 1 \mod 561$<br>

  shows clearly that since $x \equiv 1 \mod 3$ holds only for $x = 1$ or 
  $2^{2(k)}$ with $k >= 0$; if $a$ is not coprime with $z$ (shares at least a factor) $a \equiv 1 \mod 561$ 
  won't be possible. Infact:<br>

  $x \equiv 1 \mod 187$<br>
  $x \equiv 0 \mod 3$<br>

  is possible, for ex. applying the Euler's Theorem (since $11 \times 17$ is not prime):<br>

  $3^{\phi(11)\phi(17)} \equiv 1 \mod 187$<br>
  $3^{\phi(11)\phi(17)} \equiv 0 \mod 3$

  since $3$ and $187$ are coprimes, while:

  $x \equiv 1 \mod 187$<br>
  $x \equiv 0 \mod 3$<br>
  $\equiv$<br>
  $x \equiv 1 \mod 561$<br>

  is not.<br>

  -----<br>
  $N_{1} = 3$<br>
  $n_{1} =$ ? <br>
  $3 * n_{1} + (- z_{1}) * 187 = 1$ <br>
  $3 * 125 - 1 = 2 * 187$ --- BI.<br>
  $n_{1} = 125$<br>
  $a_{1}N_{1}n_{1} = 1 * 3 * 125 = 375$<br>
  -----<br>
  $N_{2} = 187$ <br>
  $n_{2} =$ ? <br>
  $187 * n_{2} + (- z_{2}) * 3 = 1$ <br>
  $187 * 1 - 1 = 62 * 3$ <br>
  $n_{2} = 1$<br>
  $a_{2}N_{2}n_{2} = 0 * 187 * 1 = 0$<br>
  -----<br>
  $x \equiv a_{1}N_{1}n_{1} + a_{2}N_{2}n_{2} (\mod m_{1} * m_{2})$ <br>
  -><br>
  $x \equiv 375 + 0 (\mod 561)$ <br>
  -><br>
  $x \equiv 375 (\mod 561)$ <br>

  Which is clearly not $1$. If we had $x \equiv 1 \mod 3$:<br>

  $a_{2}N_{2}n_{2} = 1 * 187 * 1 = 0$<br>
  -----<br>
  $x \equiv a_{1}N_{1}n_{1} + a_{2}N_{2}n_{2} (\mod m_{1} * m_{2})$ <br>
  -><br>
  $x \equiv 375 + 187 (\mod 561)$ <br>
  -><br>
  $x \equiv 1 (\mod 561)$ <br>

  which is quite obvious at this point. The interesting thing, is that:

  $x \equiv 1 \mod 187$<br>
  $x \equiv 0 \mod 3$<br>
  $\equiv$<br>
  $x \equiv 1 \mod 561$<br>

  is not possible, but this doesn't mean that

  $x \equiv 1 \mod 187$<br>
  $x \equiv 0 \mod 3$<br>
  $\equiv$<br>
  $x \equiv ? \mod 561$<br>

  is not possible, infact as we have just seen the solution is $x \equiv 375 (\mod 561)$: <br>

  $x \equiv 1 \mod 187$<br>
  $x \equiv 0 \mod 3$<br>
  $\equiv$<br>
  $x \equiv 375 \mod 561$<br>
  -><br>
  $375 \equiv 1 \mod 187$<br>
  $375 \equiv 0 \mod 3$<br>

  Now, another interesting thing is that 'accidentally': $3^{\phi(3)\phi(11)\phi(17)} \equiv 375 \mod (3)(11)(17)$. Infact the Euler's Theorem holds only if $a$ ($3$ in this case) and $n$ (561) are coprimes (the proof itself keeps this restriction), i.e. if they were coprimes the formula would be: $a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \mod n$.

  Now, since my brain is fried thanks to this primality test, let's try to show an example/proof for this and end this section.

  $3 \times z_{187 coprime} \mod 3 \times 187$

  From this example we can easily imagine the left part as series of $3$ elements added, and the right part too. This means that since $z_{187 coprime}$ and $187$ are coprimes, their modulo will never 'produce' $0$, and this means that any result produced (which will be $0 < z < 187$) will be multiplied by $3$. This is why having a term which is not coprime with the modulo will never 'produce' $1$ as remainder, but only multiples of that term, and this obviously is why the Euler's Theorem holds only for $a$ and $n$ coprimes and also why every non-coprime z with $0 < z < n$ can't have a multiplicative modular inverse. And it's not over, this is also why the Fermat's primality test works fine (when I say that it works, I mean that it manages to recognise that a number is prime or not) when we take $a$ and $n$ non-coprime (where $n$ is not prime obviously).<br>
  <br>
  [ This reasoning works in general proving this fact ].<br>
  <br>
  Before concluding this section let's see how math keeps pushing us to the truth. From the initial reasoning, math tells us that $Z_{3}^{\ast}$ can be removed from $Z_{3}^{\ast} \times Z_{11}^{\ast} \times Z_{17}^{\ast}$ when considering non-coprimes (which share the $3$ factor in this case). Infact:

  $3^{\phi(3)\phi(11)\phi(17)} \equiv 375 \mod (3)(11)(17)$<br>
  $3^{\phi(11)\phi(17)} \equiv 375 \mod (3)(11)(17)$

  and the latter

  $3^{\phi(11)\phi(17)} \equiv 1 \mod (11)(17)$<br>
